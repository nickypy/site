Street Jenga augments the [standard rules](https://www.jenga.com/about.php) of Jenga to facilitate many different chaotic play styles. The modifications to the rules are as follows:

1. You may knock out more than one block at a time, given that knocking out multiple blocks is done in one movement. For example, if you can grip two blocks and pull both of those out at the same time, then that would be a perfectly legal move.
2. You may use items to facilitate the removal of blocks. These items include but are not limited to: chopsticks, pliers, cans of compressed air, spatulas, and yarn.
3. You may delegate your move to another person or animal, but you must accept the consequences of your delegateâ€™s move. If the elected party has a stake in the game (like an opponent for example), they must make a best faith effort in the move.
4. You may add or remove rules to Street Jenga at any time, as long as all other players agree to those terms.
